# Power BI and Python Integration - Car Sales Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of **Power BI** and **Python** to create interactive visualizations and insights related to car sales. The dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of car models, their sales, and customer information. It combines the data manipulation and analysis power of Python with the dynamic visualization capabilities of Power BI.

## Features

- **Car Models Overview**: Visual representation of different car models and their sales performance.
- **Customer Demographics**: Charts showcasing who bought the cars, segmented by various demographics.
- **Sales Trends**: Interactive visualizations of sales trends over time, by car models and customers.
- **Python Integration**: Data processing and advanced analytics performed in Python, with results visualized in Power BI.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboard layout.
- **Python**: Employed for data cleaning, analysis, and producing additional visualizations.
    - **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
  
## How to Run the Project

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure you have the required car sales data in CSV format. If needed, adjust the data preprocessing steps in the Python script.
2. **Python Script**: Run the Python script to clean the data, perform analysis, and export necessary results for Power BI.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: Open the Power BI file and link it to the processed data from Python. Adjust visualizations as needed.
4. **Custom Analysis**: Modify the Python code or Power BI layout to suit additional needs or data sources.

## Installation and Dependencies

### Python:
Make sure you have Python installed with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Power BI:
Download and install Power BI Desktop from [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).

## Usage

1. Modify the `config.py` file (if available) to point to your dataset.
2. Run the Python script to generate necessary analysis and datasets.
3. Open the Power BI file and refresh the data sources to update the dashboard.
4. Explore the visualizations to gain insights into car models, sales, and customer trends.
